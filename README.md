# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

## Overview
This study examines the link between maternal folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy and the risk of delivering a low birth weight (LBW) infant, defined as a birth weight below 2,500 grams.1 LBW is associated with higher neonatal morbidity and long-term health issues. Folic acid, vital for fetal development, may help prevent LBW by supporting placental health. Using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), the study finds that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy appears to reduce LBW risk, while pre-pregnancy intake may slightly increase it. Socioeconomic factors, such as education and income, as well as race and prenatal care, also play significant roles in LBW outcomes.
